   ```bash
   # Copy setup-database.sql content into Supabase SQL Editor and run
   # Create "user-files" storage bucket (private) in Supabase dashboard
   ```

2. **▶️ Start Development Servers**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd frontend && npm start
   
   # Terminal 2  
   cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
   ```

3. **🧪 Test Complete Flow**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000
